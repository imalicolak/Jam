## Product Description

Sweeten your day with Jam, the internet's tastiest new (web-based) messaging platform! Sign up, add your contacts, and jam out with your friends! Jams allow you to message individually, or in small groups, but if you ever have too many jams, you can store them in a jar! Jars allow you to link up with large groups of other users, organize your communications, and jam out with your team. That's the spread, and we hope you like it.
